        <h2>Introduction to Tailwind CSS</h2>
        <p>
            Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides a set of
            pre-defined classes to style your HTML elements. Unlike traditional
            CSS frameworks that come with pre-designed components, Tailwind CSS
            focuses on providing low-level utility classes that you can combine
            to build custom designs.

                configuration file. You can easily change colors, spacing,
                typography, and more to match your project's branding.

                you can rapidly prototype and build UI components by leveraging
                its extensive set of utility classes. It eliminates the need to

                <strong>Responsive design made easy:</strong> Tailwind CSS
                provides responsive utility classes that make it straightforward
                to create responsive layouts. You can easily define different
                styles for various screen sizes without writing media queries
                manually.

            <li>
                <strong>Optimized for performance:</strong> Tailwind CSS generates
                optimized CSS by purging unused styles during the build process.
                This results in smaller file sizes and faster loading times for
                your web pages.

        <p>
            To start using Tailwind CSS in your project, you need to install it
            via npm or yarn. Once installed, you can include the Tailwind CSS
            file in your HTML or import it in your JavaScript files if you're
            using a bundler like webpack.
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code className="language-javascript">
                &lt;link href="path/to/tailwind.css" rel="stylesheet"&gt;
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
            After including the CSS file, you can start using Tailwind CSS
            classes in your HTML elements. Refer to the official Tailwind CSS
            documentation for a comprehensive list of available utility classes
            and their usage.
